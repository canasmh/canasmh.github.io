                I am a second year graduate student of Astronomy at New Mexico State University. I was born in Colombia, but
            moved to the United States at a very young age. I grew up in Greenville, South Carolina, which I will always
            consider to be my hometown. After graduating high school, I moved to Charleston, SC to attend the College of
            Charleston. I was initially interested in business and economics, but quickly discovered that my passion lies in
            Physics and Astronomy. As such, I joined the department of Physics and Astronomy, working under the mentorship of
            Dr. George Chartas, where I studied quasar outflows through the use of X-ray data obtained with the XMM-Newton
            and Chandra X-ray space observatories. In 2018, I graduated from the College of Charleston with a B.S. in
            Astrophysics and a B.S. in Physics.
            </p>

                After graduating from the College of Charleston, I spent a few months in Jackson Hole, Wyoming working for
            a 501(c)3 non-profit organization known as Wyoming Stargazing. I worked as a <i>Stargazing Leader</i>, and it
            was my job to proivde an unforgettable tour of the night sky to  tourists and locals through the use of
            telescopes and powerful laser pointers. The job was an excellent way for me to become acquainted with some of
            the most popular constellations, the brightest and most significant stars, and some of the most prominent deep
            sky objects. As such, I become very familiar with the location of objects in the night sky, and gained a
            tremendous amount of practice in explaining complex astrophysical phenomena to a general public.

            <p class="new-paragraph">
                In the fall of 2019, I chose to go New Mexico State University because of the profound impacts the Apache
                Point Observatory and Sloan Digital Sky Survey have had in the astronomical community. I also greatly appreciated
                that the founder of the Astronomy department at NMSU was none other than Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of
                the dwarf planet, Pluto. Since my admission, I have been working with Dr. Lyra studying the origin of Kuiper
                belt objects through the streaming instability of ices and silicates.

                Aside from astronomy, I enjoy traveling, photography, programming and stargazing ðŸ¤©. I am taking
                extracurricular courses in programming and web development, which is how I was able to create this
                beautiful website that you have stumbled across. As part of this awesome Web Development course that I'm
                taking on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">
                Udemy</a>, I have made the following silly projects:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use your keyboard to <a href="play_the_drums/index.html" target="_blank">play the drums</a>.</li>
                <li>Settle your disputes with the <a href="dice/index.html" target="_blank">roll of a dice</a>.</li>
                <li>Test your memory by playing a game of <a href="simon/index.html" target="_blank">Simon</a>.</li>

            <p class="new-paragraph">
                <span style="letter-spacing: 3px">...</span>  and more to come!</li>
